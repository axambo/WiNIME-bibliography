# WiNIME-bibliography

This is the bibliography files (in BibTeX format) used in the paper [“Who Are the Women Authors in NIME? - Improving Gender Balance in NIME Research”](http://annaxambo.me/pub/Xambo_2018_WiNIME.pdf) (Xambó 2018) published in the Proceedings of NIME 2017. This bilbiography is a selected subset from the [NIME-blibiography](https://github.com/NIME-conference/NIME-bibliography) repository. The data was sanitized (e.g., errors, redundancies) and a manual identification of gender was conducted to distill the women authors at NIME ranging the years 2001 to 2017. This bibliography is also linked to the directory of [WiNIME](https://axambo.github.io/directory-of-winime/), which aims to make more visible NIME women authors's work.
